# Mission-to-Mars
In this project we scraped various webpages to curate information and images of interest. The scripts were created mostly in python to create a webpage with flask, however it involved interpreting html elements in order to find the correct information to scrape. These scripts should work into the future barring any changes to the relevant web pages.
